      <title>Coaching Benefits Reporting</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/coaching-benefits-reporting</link>
      <pubDate>2013-12-20</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of any &lt;a href="/agile-coaching-engagements"&gt;Agile Adoption&lt;/a&gt; engagement, client stakeholders will start wondering about the benefits received from coaching. This may be for their own curiosity, to justify ROI to their bosses, or simply to show off their initiatives to peers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often this translates into a &lt;em&gt;Coaching Benefits Report&lt;/em&gt;. But I doubt if a set template would work. Different stakeholders have different objectives, and the report may need to be presented accordingly. Some reports may stress on the subjective aspects, while others may rely on objective ones. Some may be formal in language, while others may have a more lively feel to them. In any case, some aspects you can touch upon are mentioned below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_0"&gt;Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the third time I talk about &lt;em&gt;metrics&lt;/em&gt;. We used metrics for &lt;a href="/metrics-baselining"&gt;baselining&lt;/a&gt;; we used it for &lt;a href="/measuring-progress"&gt;measuring progress&lt;/a&gt;; and we will use it for a Before/After comparison in a Benefits document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: you got some numbers when you started the engagement with an assessment; you saw how the numbers varied during active coaching; and finally, the numbers have reached a certain level when it&amp;#39;s time to wrap up. A Before/After will typically stress on comparing the starting numbers against the final numbers; in an appendix, you could attach a trend graph for what happened in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this obvious approach to metrics, I want to call out some gotchas, basically some numbers that could confuse you and your stakeholders at first look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_1"&gt;Sample Case Study 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During assessment you measure Defect Count within Iteration, ie, the number of defects found by QA for the iteration&amp;#39;s stories within the iteration itself. You find it to be 10. After active coaching, let&amp;#39;s say you expected a decrease in defects. Turns out the number has increased to 15!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and your stakeholders may end up asking: what Agile Coaching have we done that actually led to an increase in defects?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: Earlier the team&amp;#39;s process and practices were such that a high number of defects were actually slipping through. These were caught at later stages, unfortunately, mostly in production by end users. By improving on the processes and practices, the team is now catching defects earlier. With a clearer view on quality, the team is ready to focus on these concern areas better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_2"&gt;Sample Case Study 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider per iteration, the % of stories that have automated tests. During assessment of a team which had already started some Agile practices, let&amp;#39;s say the number was 50%. We measure this number again to get final numbers before wrapping up, and we see it&amp;#39;s 35%!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened?! Was the team better off on their own, before Agile Coaching?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. The last iteration we measured just happened to be during Christmas time, when most of the team was on leave, and most of the work happened to be spikes or proof of concept, done in a temporary code repository, in preparation for a new features coming in the new year backed by a fresh tech stack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_3"&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that relying on simple number comparisons can throw us off, leading us to wrong conclusions. I&amp;#39;ve called this out before, and will repeat: metrics are simply indicators, not guarantees, and should be supported with subjectivity. That said, numbers can still be useful. In cases like above, when the results seem surprising, consider these approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use complementary metrics (eg. Use Defect Count per Environment in addition to Defect Count within Iteration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a Trend Graph instead of a Before/After comparison&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a mean or average value over multiple recent iterations instead of just the latest numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present ratios or percentages along with the absolute numbers, not in isolation (eg. 7% coverage increase meant ~6000 LOC in a huge legacy code base)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_4"&gt;Surveys &amp;amp; Feedback Forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To capture team skills improvement, and general shifts in mindset, use &lt;em&gt;surveys&lt;/em&gt; that have a mix of subjective and objective type of questions. You may have conducted such surveys during assessment, and you could conduct a similar one towards the end of the engagement. Sometimes people challenge if certain aspects of team behaviour can be tied to coaching efforts, claiming those changes may have happened without coaching too. While this may be true, collecting specific &lt;em&gt;coaching-related feedback&lt;/em&gt; can help evaluate the contribution of coaching to such behavioural changes. Such feedback may also be collected using surveys in addition to in-person feedback. It is important to clarify that the feedback is for gauging what worked and what could be improved, and that honest answers will not reflect badly on the Coach in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_5"&gt;Pictures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say, &lt;em&gt;a picture is worth a thousand words&lt;/em&gt;. Feel free to include pictures of team stand-ups, retrospective stickies, information radiators, etc, in the Benefits document. Compared to dry numbers, pictures make the entire engagement seem more real and worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_6"&gt;Success Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of making things seem more real, try to weave the team&amp;#39;s journey on the Agile path into a clear-to-understand &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;, of where we began, what all we tried, successes and failures, and eventual sustenance. You may represent these on a timeline or simply as bulleted list of highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_7"&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can end a Benefits report with a &lt;em&gt;Next Steps&lt;/em&gt; section. This should cover recommendations on what the team, the department, and the organization should focus on next, so that even without formal Agile Coaching, sustenance is continued, learnings are shared, and further improvements happen in creative and innovative ways, not just reactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do not forget to share drafts of the Coaching Benefits Report with the client stakeholder as you write it, so that you get feedback and are able to meet the report&amp;#39;s objective, catering to the intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-discovery</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/self-discovery</link>
      <pubDate>2013-12-19</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-discovery&lt;/em&gt; is important for an individual to understand oneself better, and to continuously grow or evolve. While important for one&amp;#39;s personal life, it is also applicable to one&amp;#39;s professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="/coaching-basics"&gt;coaching&lt;/a&gt;, one of the goals is to aid individuals to gain better awareness of their own potential. While one way to address this is to provide continuous feedback, it additionally helps if individuals are enabled to learn more about themselves on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tools that I have personally found useful and have recommended to others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://strengths.gallup.com/110440/About-StrengthsFinder-20.aspx"&gt;Strengths Finder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mindtimemaps.com/"&gt;MindTimeMaps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other activity-based suggestions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.noop.nl/2011/09/moving-motivators-free-exercise.html"&gt;Moving Motivators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.jthoenes.net/personal-retrospectives/"&gt;Personal Retrospectives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you take online questionnaires, conduct introspective exercises or retrospectives, or simply reflect on feedback received, it is useful to take some time out to think about yourself and your place in the surrounding context. Having gone through certain experiences and learnings, reflecting on those and imbibing key takeaways will ensure that you grow in the process. Else there is a risk that each incident, whether good or bad, remains just as an incident in your memory, and does not become an opportunity to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-discovery in individuals, combined with &lt;a href="/self-learning"&gt;self-learning&lt;/a&gt;, is key to sustenance, especially in Agile Coaching.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self-learning</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/self-learning</link>
      <pubDate>2013-12-18</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good degree of &lt;em&gt;self-learning&lt;/em&gt; is expected out of every individual being coached during an &lt;a href="/agile-coaching-engagements"&gt;Agile Adoption&lt;/a&gt;. Without it, individuals cannot move through the various stages of learning as put across by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition"&gt;Dreyfus Model&lt;/a&gt;. An Agile Coach may pair on tasks with individuals but such an approach is limited by team size, and one-on-one attention cannot be given for extended durations of time. After all, the way an Agile Coach operates is different from that of a Personal Trainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Agile Coach will usually focus on providing the building blocks, and then set the individual on the path of self-learning. This is the approach right from the onset, where instead of spoon-feeding answers, the coach will use effective questioning to guide the individual to come up with their own reasonable conclusions. This is an application of what is widely known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method"&gt;Socratic Method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally what I follow is the &lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/hr/learning/philosophy/"&gt;Princeton Model&lt;/a&gt; of learning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Princeton Model" src="/assets/media/images/coaching/princeton-model.png" style="float:right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px; width: auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;70%&lt;/em&gt; of the skills adoption comes from real work done on the ground. I pair with individuals on actual project work, and have coached individuals pair with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;20%&lt;/em&gt; of the skills adoption happens via workshops, sessions, and demos. These workshops are conducted by me or other invited experts. Demos and knowledge-sharing brown bag sessions are conducted on a regular basis within the team, where team members themselves volunteer to show-and-tell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;10%&lt;/em&gt; of skills exposure happens via reading. Links to relevant articles and blogs are shared via mailing lists or wiki pages. Book recommendations are also made, and possibly added to a library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have also seen encourage self-learning in teams is to throw challenges at them, and see them cope with it by upgrading their skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="float:left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px; width: auto"&gt;
  &lt;img alt="Challenges vs Skills" src="/assets/media/images/coaching/challenges-vs-skills.png" style="border: 1px solid silver"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;small class="muted"&gt;Graph introduced to me by &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/julian-parry/3/999/31"&gt;Jules Parry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an individual is dealing with challenges which are underwhelming, and do not require full utilization of existing skills, the individual gets bored or complacent. If, however, the individual is put up with overwhelming challenges, the individual will experience some frustration or stress, and will either try to reduce the challenges or will learn skills appropriate to overcome the challenges. If steered toward the latter behaviour, the person grows in competence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the ways in which self-learning can take place in individuals and teams. They are effective tools to use during active coaching, to make a team reach levels of sustenance. This process may lead some individuals down the path to &lt;a href="/self-discovery"&gt;self-discovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measuring Progress</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/measuring-progress</link>
      <pubDate>2013-12-17</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If you can not measure it, you can not improve it.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin"&gt;Lord Kelvin&lt;/a&gt; is accredited with the above quote. He was not talking about Agile software development but he was probably on to &lt;em&gt;continuous improvement&lt;/em&gt;. The latter is &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html"&gt;integral&lt;/a&gt; to the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A positive change on a metric can be an &lt;em&gt;indicator&lt;/em&gt; of progress or improvement. It is not a guarantee of progress but an indicator. Perhaps if we combine different metrics, all indicating progress on interconnected concepts, we can have higher confidence that there is improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_0"&gt;Sample Case Study&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us say Team A and Team B both start off with 2% code coverage. There is strong &lt;em&gt;encouragement&lt;/em&gt; from Management that coverage needs to improve. Team A adopts a traditional unit testing approach, ie, adding tests after code is written. Team B adopts TDD, ie, writing test first and then code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Team A has 25% code coverage. Team B has 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which team has made better progress?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer is we don&amp;#39;t know. If we treat &lt;em&gt;measuring progress&lt;/em&gt; as equivalent to &lt;em&gt;measuring code coverage&lt;/em&gt;, clearly Team A is better off. But is progress the same as code coverage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us bring in another metric: Avg Defect Count per Iteration. Let&amp;#39;s say Team A and B both started with 20. After the two months, Team A has a defect count of 12, while Team B has 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="1"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Team&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Coverage - Before&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Avg Defect Count - Before&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Coverage - After&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Avg Defect Count - After&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which team has made better progress?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these combined metrics, we are tempted to say Team B. Because having lesser defects seems associated with quality improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps for Team B, TDD led to better understanding of new features and improved quality. However, it did not increase code coverage for existing code that was not touched. On the other hand, Team A focused on increasing code coverage but the effectiveness of the covering tests was questionable, which resulted in higher coverage but not a proportional gain in quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, our answer could still be wrong! Perhaps Team B had a couple of QAs go on vacation, which led to some stories not being tested exhaustively (functional, manual, exploratory, etc), and hence, lesser defects were found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning is that these numbers are all indicators, and subjectivity has to be applied. Measuring progress is not about measuring numbers. Continuous improvement is not about improving numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_1"&gt;Techniques&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having established that, indicators are still necessary and can be an asset during &lt;a href="/agile-coaching-roles"&gt;Agile Coaching&lt;/a&gt;. If we feel the team is making progress, an improvement in numbers will support that. Corollary is that if numbers show a downward trend, we need to investigate if there are slippages or reasonable circumstances to account for that. For all the following suggestions, what is useful is tracking them over a period of time. Based on context, you could decided how frequently to capture them, and how to analyze the results, and if any action item is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_2"&gt;Metrics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metrics used for &lt;em&gt;baselining&lt;/em&gt; can be used for continuous monitoring. Remember to choose metrics based on goals, and definitely choose more than one. You can read more &lt;a href="/metrics-baselining"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_3"&gt;Confidence Meter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another technique I have seen used effectively is a &lt;em&gt;Confidence Meter&lt;/em&gt;. On or near the Story Wall, we could have a flipchart or whiteboard area to capture the confidence which individual team members have in making a successful release at the end of the iteration. 90% or higher reflects great confidence while anything lower than 30% shows lack of confidence. Team members could update these numbers against their name at the end of a stand up, and if there is a wide variance in perspectives, it could trigger discussions immediately instead of waiting till a Retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="toc_4"&gt;Surveys&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One technique, strong on subjectivity, is &lt;em&gt;Surveys&lt;/em&gt;. It may seem casual and imprecise but the results can be revealing. A good survey will have a mix of objective and subjective questions. An objective question could be &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Has frequency and pace of refactoring increased?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, with options ranging from &lt;em&gt;0 (Barely)&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;5 (Great extent)&lt;/em&gt;. A subjective comment box could capture something like &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Do you feel confident to help others with XP Practices, and in what areas?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can come up with more things to track to indicate progress in your team&amp;#39;s context. It also helps motivation if you can make the trend visible, perhaps by using Big Visible Charts or Information Radiators. But yes, ever so often, do check and remind people that the goal is to make progress and to improve on aspects that provide value to the Business or end users, and not to get solely number-driven.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facilitation Techniques</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/facilitation-techniques</link>
      <pubDate>2013-12-16</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facilitation is a very useful skill to have. It helps not only in &lt;a href="/coaching-basics"&gt;coaching&lt;/a&gt; but in many day-to-day activities. Whether a team discussion or a team activity, a good facilitator can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common facilitation technique is a &lt;em&gt;Retrospective&lt;/em&gt;. It has a clear objective of looking back, as a group, at a recent time period or a particular incident, collect thoughts around different aspects, and then brainstorm on action items related to the topic. Agile teams use this technique for continuous improvement. I like relating it to &lt;a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html"&gt;the 12th Agile Principle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are some well-known Retrospective formats, I try to customize the experience based on context. This could be how the recent iteration went, the motivation levels of the team, concepts that the team can relate to, or sometimes just something random that could be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="Retro" src="/assets/media/images/coaching/retro.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small class="muted"&gt;Retro using a Fuel/Mud analogy&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;Future-spective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variation of the Retrospective is a &lt;em&gt;Future-spective&lt;/em&gt;. As the name suggests, it is not about looking back but about looking forward. Such an exercise helps in goal-setting, expectation-setting, coming up with a common vision, and sometimes an actionable plan. Typically it involves having the group imagine that they are in the future, and then describing what they see has gone well or what has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_2"&gt;Mind Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesser used technique for facilitation is &lt;em&gt;Mind Mapping&lt;/em&gt;. A number of people have discovered it for personal use. I have used it in group situations as well, whether to make my own thoughts visual so that others can follow or to capture thoughts of the group, presenting it back to them in real time. Having thoughts captured visually and linked together, helps explore the topic space even further, and make stronger connections between different ideas. It also helps retention. Mind Mapping can be used effectively for cause-effect analysis or for drilling down a concept into granular levels which are more easily recognizable or actionable. In fact, you could use this technique in a Retrospective to draw out effective action items after points have been put forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_3"&gt;Fishbowl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may be facilitating a large group, or a group that isn&amp;#39;t very vocal, or perhaps a topic that is a bit controversial. In all of these cases, having an effective discussion may be difficult. Here a technique called as &lt;em&gt;Fishbowl&lt;/em&gt; can help. It is a constrained form of discussion where there are set rules for participation. At any given point in time, there is a panel with a fixed number of chairs. Out of these chairs, all but one can be filled by people who wish to participate in the discussion. If someone new steps in and sits on the vacant chair, one of the other participants has to volunteer to step out. This encourages multiple viewpoints to be heard, and discourages anyone from overtaking the discussion for long. With groups that are not vocal, having many chairs empty creates an awkward situation, forcing a few people to self-nominate themselves for the panel discussion. Seeing a few people start off, others feel encouraged to join in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are even more facilitation techniques that one can employ, for example, &lt;em&gt;fist of five&lt;/em&gt;. It is good to have them in your toolkit especially if you are in a role that could benefit from a collaborative team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_4"&gt;Further Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
