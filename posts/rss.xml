      <title>Agile Coaching Roles</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/agile-coaching-roles</link>
      <pubDate>2013-12-14</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To me, &lt;a href="/coaching-basics"&gt;Coaching&lt;/a&gt; is about getting the most out of individuals or teams by raising their awareness levels, about their current environment, about the environment outside theirs, and most important of all, about their own potential. This is done mostly by asking them the right questions, and not by providing them ready-made answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My definition of an &lt;em&gt;Agile Coach&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, is less restrictive. As an Agile Coach, coaching is my primary &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt;. But there are times when I make recommendations based on my practitioner background. I also complement coaching with aspects of mentoring and training. For example, relating personal experiences and sharing useful resources can increase someone&amp;#39;s curiosity and give them a clear direction. Conducting a workshop can help kickstart a group on practices like TDD and Refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even within the scope of Agile Coaching, I have been exposed to a variety of roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_0"&gt;Role-based Practices Coaching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Agile Coach helps team members understand their roles in an Agile setting. This involves skills-building. You may join a team as a single cross-skilled coach or as a trio of role-specific coaches: a Tech Coach, a QA Coach, and a BA Coach. With Developers, a coach will pair actively to spread practices like TDD, Refactoring, CI, etc, and will run workshops and brown bag sessions. With Testers, a coach could cover creating test scenarios from acceptance criteria, automated testing, test pyramid, and so on. For Business Analysts or Product Owners, the focus will be on prioritization exercises, negotiation skills, story writing, story slicing, determining NFRs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_1"&gt;Process Coaching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While focusing on role-specific skills and practices is important, some teams may need help in determining what process works for them, adapting them over time, and so on. This could involve defining how each role contributes to the process, and also in general, how the entire team collaborates and focuses on improvement. Having effective stand ups, planning meetings, demos, and retrospectives fall under this. Other aspects could involve helping the team determine some metrics to observe and improve. Eg: pairing matrix, confidence meter, build failures in a day, velocity, cycle time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_2"&gt;Leadership Coaching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, it is not only team members who need coaching, but their leadership as well. These may include the Team Lead, the Project Manager, the Architect Head, the Programme Manager, the Department Head, and so on. The conversation topics are usually broader level and strategic, such as prioritization of teams for Agile adoption, facilitating empowered teams, investing in appropriate infrastructure or continuous delivery initiatives, reducing overhead in IT policies, identifying improvements in architecture and ecosystem, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In most cases, a single Agile Coach on an engagement will touch upon all of the above but to varying degrees. It will be a factor of the company culture, need of the hour, and personal motivations of the people involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following provide further insights:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coaching Basics</title>

      <pubDate>2013-12-09</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;Coaching&lt;/em&gt; is overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparatively, terms like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.refactoring.com/"&gt;Refactoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt"&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are recently invented. But despite having had clear definitions to start with, these words still suffer from &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RefactoringMalapropism.html"&gt;malapropism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coaching&lt;/em&gt; is a plain English word, around since ages. It is not surprising that its definition in the professional world remains open. This is evident from its &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaching"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there have been attempts to describe coaching better, acknowledging the wide spectrum it could cover, and yet putting some boundaries to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal view on the term is still evolving despite having played the Agile Coach role. So far I&amp;#39;ve kept it simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaching is not classroom training; it is interpersonal; it creates awareness in individuals and teams; it is more about asking than telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check these links for less &lt;em&gt;fuzzy&lt;/em&gt; definitions:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Common code smells</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/common-code-smells</link>
      <pubDate>2013-04-21</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have worked on multiple systems written in object-oriented languages. Time and again, I encounter common code smells. What is curious is that these smells are observable not only in legacy&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; systems but also in well-intentioned greenfield&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could ascribe these to the developers not knowing any better, or possibly to a more common reason, &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html"&gt;Technical Debt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I have learnt that being conscious of these code smells is important while working with code bases. Simply learning about the code smells is not enough. You need to actively look out for them &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step, after identifying the smell, is of course to deal with it. For now, I will only list the code smells. I am planning a separate series of &lt;em&gt;nugget&lt;/em&gt; posts to get into more details later. But don&amp;#39;t wait for those posts! Read &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html"&gt;the Refactoring book&lt;/a&gt; now for most of the common smells!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;The smells!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_1"&gt;In both legacy and greenfield projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple assignments to local variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Law of Demeter violation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data clumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Null checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Primitive obsession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature envy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using language features or core APIs like &lt;code&gt;Collections.emptyList()&lt;/code&gt; wrongly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_2"&gt;Usually in legacy systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setters in domain objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of Singleton pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Violations of layered architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commented code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_3"&gt;Usually in greenfield systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Field injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inappropriate mocking, such as misuse of &lt;code&gt;Mockito.any()&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Mockito.when()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests not respecting architecture layers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complicated setup in unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep adding to these lists over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
[1] For the purposes of this post and others, I will use &amp;quot;legacy&amp;quot; to mean systems that have survived for nearly 10 years or more, running on old or raw technologies like Servlets, JDBC, etc, and without much automated test coverage. There may have been attempts to mix in new technologies and increase test coverage but the majority is still legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] I will use &amp;quot;greenfield&amp;quot; to mean systems that are written in recent times. They run on newer technologies, using frameworks for MVC, ORM, IoC, etc. I will assume that the developers are aware of clean code practices and do unit testing, perhaps even TDD along with refactoring.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From Practitioner to Coach - I</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/from-practitioner-to-coach-i</link>
      <pubDate>2013-04-03</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For an organization to be successful at Agile transformation, one aspect that needs attention is self-sustenance. Having external coaches is useful as they bring in experience and a third-party perspective. Over time though, it makes sense to groom internal Agile practitioners as Agile champions, who can spread the mindset and practices further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transitioning from a practitioner to a coach is non-trivial. The organization should look out for certain characteristics in individuals to identify potential coaches, and follow that up by providing support to prepare them for the role. In a series of articles, we will delve into each of these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, let us establish practitioner-to-coach transition as an effective strategy for Agile transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When do we know we are done?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult question to answer at the onset of any Agile enablement undertaking. Some answers rely on metrics, measuring how the coached teams have progressed in those. A more subjective answer, but perhaps more relevant, relies on people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are done coaching a team when team members are capable of coaching others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is indicative of the skills, mindset, and experiences picked up by team members. On the ground, not every team member will reach the same level at the same time, and while many may progress as practitioners, they may not make good coaches. Coaching does not come naturally to everyone, not even to long-time practitioners. One needs certain qualities and skills that require further grooming. We will talk about this in more detail later. For now let us assume we can get good coaches out of a coached team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="toc_1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can producing internal coaches benefit Agile transformation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a simple illustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FakeFincorp Ltd is an organization looking at Agile transformation. They have multiple co-located teams. They hire an Agile Coach, named &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt;, to help them on their Agile journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: in the diagrams below, the &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; circle represents the external coach; the &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; circles represent team members; the &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; circles represent team members who are ready to transition into a coaching role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_2"&gt;Step 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="step 1" src="/assets/media/images/from-practitioner-to-coach-i/agile-transformation-step01.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt; works actively with the team members of only one team. Other teams may choose to continue working in their regular manner or try to emulate the coached team. However, &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s focus remains on the one team he is actively coaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_3"&gt;Step 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="step 2" src="/assets/media/images/from-practitioner-to-coach-i/agile-transformation-step02.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent considerable time with a particular team, &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt; gets a sense of the various team members&amp;#39; strengths. He identifies two individuals, &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;, who demonstrate qualities suitable for a coaching role. He now gears his coaching style towards a coach-the-coach approach, focusing on these individuals. Over a short duration, &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt; picks up coaching skills comfortably while &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt; could use more mentoring on the coaching aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_4"&gt;Step 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="step 3" src="/assets/media/images/from-practitioner-to-coach-i/agile-transformation-step03.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confident of &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s coaching ability, &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt; pulls &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt; and himself out of the team, leaving &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;John&lt;/span&gt; in charge of sustaining the Agile mindset and practices in that team. Capacity is adjusted by bringing fresh members into the team. &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt; together move into the next team that will undergo Agile coaching. &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt; works as a team member but continues to focus on picking up coaching skills. &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt; balances coaching the new team actively along with his coach-the-coach approach for &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt;. Every now and then, he allows &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt; to take a lead in coaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_5"&gt;Step 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="step 4" src="/assets/media/images/from-practitioner-to-coach-i/agile-transformation-step04.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, another practitioner in the new team seems to emerge as a potential coach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_6"&gt;Step 5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="step 5" src="/assets/media/images/from-practitioner-to-coach-i/agile-transformation-step05.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like before, when the time is right, &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt; moves out of the team with the new potential coach, leaving a more confident &lt;span style="color:#0C0"&gt;Jane&lt;/span&gt; in charge of the previous team. The approach continues across multiple teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_7"&gt;Step 6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="step 6" src="/assets/media/images/from-practitioner-to-coach-i/agile-transformation-step06.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a point, &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;s role becomes more of a specialist or expert consultant that the internal coaches leverage. &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Jake&lt;/span&gt; oversees the progress of the internal coaches and provides guidance where required. Most of the changes are now channelized through the internal coaches on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_8"&gt;Step 7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="step 7" src="/assets/media/images/from-practitioner-to-coach-i/agile-transformation-step07.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some stage, when both FakeFincorp Ltd and the external Agile Coach agree, the Agile transformation can be deemed complete, and the remaining work of sustaining it and evolving it can be carried on internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="toc_9"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is an over-simplification that highlights the basic tenets of this strategy. Creating capable internal coaches will be more difficult in some teams than others. It will also not happen overnight. Sometimes even good internal coaches do not have enough experience to guide teams under difficult circumstances. A structured support system is needed for such an initiative to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will go deeper into these details in subsequent articles. Until then, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
