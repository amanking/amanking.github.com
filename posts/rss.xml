      <title>Rails Girls Bangalore 2015</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/rails-girls-bangalore-2015</link>
      <pubDate>2015-02-21</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://railsgirls.com/bangalore"&gt;Rails Girls Bangalore 2015&lt;/a&gt; edition was held on &lt;strong&gt;31 January 2015&lt;/strong&gt;. I had the pleasure of participating as a Coach in this workshop event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://railsgirls.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rails Girls" src="http://www.amanking.com/assets/media/images/talks/RailsGirls.png" style="margin: 20px 0px 30px 0px; width: auto"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple. As a technology community, we believe in encouraging women to join us. &lt;a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;, a web development framework, makes entry easy for someone new to web technologies. Many of us know web technologies well enough to coach someone new. Why not get together as a community and learn from each other? We could have fun in the process and even launch a few ideas into production!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails Girls Bangalore 2015 was held in the premises of &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/"&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; Bangalore office. To organize the event, a few ThoughtWorkers joined hands with Bangalore Ruby enthusiasts from other companies like &lt;a href="http://nilenso.com/"&gt;Nilenso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://c42.in/"&gt;C42&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.mavenhive.in/"&gt;MavenHive&lt;/a&gt;. The volunteers rounded up Rails Coaches for the event, spread the word about the event, and took care of logistics. And voila! We ended up having a fun day of learning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got about 100 attendees, a mix of students and working professionals. There were about 20 coaches in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coached a small team of three enthusiastic, talented girls. None had worked on &lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; before, and two were completely new to &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;.  They were recent graduates, and had limited exposure to web application development. And yet, I was pleasantly surprised and completely impressed by how much they learnt in a matter of hours. Once I explained the Git workflow, they could complete the steps on their own immediately after. They picked up &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller"&gt;MVC pattern&lt;/a&gt; and its mapping to Rails quickly, and after I gave them some command-line instructions, they set out to implement an interesting idea: an app to register for Rails Girls events across locations, viewing these registrations, and allowing messaging between attendees to coordinate group travel to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the evening, my group made decent progress, and could showcase an in-progress working solution to other participants. I was especially touched by the gratitude they expressed towards the coaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the event helped me reach out to and network with people beyond my typical circles. Hopefully contributed to motivating a few people about technology. Made new friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experience I'd love to repeat. Will encourage others to participate as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn more &lt;a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. An attendee also &lt;a href="https://abhijain27.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/getting-started-with-ruby-on-rails-at-railsgirlsblr-2015/"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; about the event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Conferences in 3 Days</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/3-conferences-in-3-days</link>
      <pubDate>2014-07-27</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17-19 July 2014&lt;/strong&gt; were exciting days for me. On each of these days, I attended different conferences on different themes with different types of audiences. The only thing in common was that all of these were in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;17 July:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amanking.com/next-generation-testing-conference-2014"&gt;Next Generation Testing Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Le M&#xE9;ridien hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;18 July:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amanking.com/jschannel-javascript-conference-2014"&gt;JSChannel JavaScript Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Taj Vivanta hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;19 July:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amanking.com/sapientnitro-what-s-next-is-now-2014"&gt;SapientNitro What's Next is Now Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Marriott hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Testing was a 2-day conference. Fellow ThoughtWorker, Vatsala Singh, and I had submitted a talk which, fortunately, got scheduled for the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; day of the conference. This allowed me to attend the JSChannel conference the next day! Something I couldn't have missed as Douglas Crockford, possibly the biggest name in JavaScript circles was giving the opening keynote! JSChannel conference was also a 2-day event which I attended only for the first day. I had to skip the second day to attend SapientNitro's 1-day conference. It was important for me to attend that as I was personally invited by someone with whom I've enjoyed working in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through these conferences, I also got to experience the food and hospitality of three renowned hotels. I was impressed the most by Marriott, followed by Taj Vivanta, and finally Le M&#xE9;ridien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure when I'll have such a whirlwind conference-attending experience again, but I will look forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SapientNitro What's Next is Now 2014</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/sapientnitro-what-s-next-is-now-2014</link>
      <pubDate>2014-07-26</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;19 July, Marriott hotel, Bangalore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SapientNitro What's Next is Now 2014" src="http://www.amanking.com/assets/media/images/talks/SapientNitroConf2014.jpg" style="float:left; margin: 20px 20px 5px 0px; width: auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invitation to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sapientnitro"&gt;SapientNitro&lt;/a&gt;'s 1-day conference was extended to me by someone with whom I had worked closely on a client-side consulting engagement. It was difficult to refuse, especially since the session topics seemed so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers were senior SapientNitro technologists who had recently completed a year-long &lt;a href="http://sapientnitroblog.com/post/92035552475"&gt;executive development programme&lt;/a&gt;. The attendees were mostly architects and senior technologists at SapientNitro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that the quality of all the speakers' presentations was top-notch, including both visuals and content. There was also an impressive consistency across everyone's slides that made the sessions through the day seamless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics I enjoyed included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized Recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Customer Loyalty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad Space Evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of parallel tracks, I had to miss other topics like Big Data, Content Marketing, Social Intelligence, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed all the sessions I attended, and had at least one question for every speaker. By the end of the day, everyone knew me as the person with a lot of questions. I was the only one representing &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com"&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; there. I got to interact with multiple SapientNitro employees, old acquaintances and new, including their leadership team. They left a positive impression on me, and overall, it was a day well-spent. I am glad I attended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JSChannel JavaScript Conference 2014</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/jschannel-javascript-conference-2014</link>
      <pubDate>2014-07-25</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;18 July, Taj Vivanta hotel, Bangalore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Douglas Crockford at JSChannel Bangalore 2014" src="http://www.amanking.com/assets/media/images/talks/DouglasCrockfordJSChannel2014.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; width: auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas. Crockford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need I say more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most esteemed name in JavaScript, the person who gave us JSON, and all those &lt;a href="http://yuiblog.com/crockford/"&gt;JS lecture videos&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; that helped thousands gain a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crockford.com/"&gt;Douglas Crockford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; gave the opening keynote. He talked about the good parts of the latest work being done on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript"&gt;JavaScript evolution&lt;/a&gt;, and some parts that he did not like. He believes JavaScript continues to suffer because it tries to accommodate beginners while reality is that most of its users are not beginners. He also introduced &lt;a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64"&gt;Dec64&lt;/a&gt; as a good option for a number data type. Douglas revisited &lt;a href="http://json.org/"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; in the current context of communication protocols. Most useful of all, was his advise to developers using JavaScript, which could be summed up succinctly as &lt;em&gt;"Don't make bugs".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas was followed by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/threepointone"&gt;Sunil Pai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from Myntra. Dressed in casual clothing, with harmless sarcastic wit, and a great sense of humour, Sunil had an effective way of presenting. He came off as relatable, passionate, and as someone who enjoys doing what he does. There is definitely some interesting work going on in Myntra, involving &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;, re-architecting, and building a scalable product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow ThoughtWorker, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/suchitpuri"&gt;Suchit Puri&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; presented some of his team's learnings involving &lt;a href="http://emberjs.com/"&gt;EmberJS&lt;/a&gt;. By the look of it, the framework seems opinionated, inspired from Rails, and solves multiple use cases in the client-side MVC domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the two parallel workshop tracks, I attended &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kmanchanda"&gt;Kapil Manchanda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;'s HTML5 Game Programming workshop. It was fun seeing a simple but fun game getting built from scratch, using &lt;a href="http://phaser.io/"&gt;phaser.io&lt;/a&gt;. I definitely got some starting insights. Perhaps I'll be able to take time off to build a game of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1 wrapped up with some lightning talks, and networking over tea. Besides a few new acquaintances, I caught up with multiple ThoughtWorkers and ex-ThoughtWorkers, and some people from a previous client-side assignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;a href="http://www.jschannel.com/"&gt;JSChannel&lt;/a&gt; continues to be a good conference, worth attending. I would have loved to attend Day 2 but had to attend a &lt;a href="http://www.amanking.com/sapientnitro-what-s-next-is-now-2014"&gt;SapientNitro conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Next Generation Testing Conference 2014</title>
      <link>http://www.amanking.com/next-generation-testing-conference-2014</link>
      <pubDate>2014-07-24</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;17 July, Le M&#xE9;ridien hotel, Bangalore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.nextgentesting.org/bangalore/2014/World_Conference_Testing/program"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; presented by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/joinunicom"&gt;Unicom Learning&lt;/a&gt;, it was attended by over 350 professionals. Interesting topics were covered by 34 speakers in all. The speakers included my colleague, &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/anandbagmar"&gt;Anand Bagmar&lt;/a&gt;, and myself. &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/vatsala-singh/1/644/b82"&gt;Vatsala Singh&lt;/a&gt;, my co-speaker and fellow ThoughtWorker, could not make it on that day due to work reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite talks from Day 1 were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=C1C07DFE86ED215E!477&amp;amp;ithint=file%2c.pdf&amp;amp;app=WordPdf&amp;amp;authkey=!ALp9b_tounqL1Co"&gt;Thinking like a Hacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/santhosh-tuppad/12/b74/338"&gt;Santhosh Shivanand Tuppad&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=C1C07DFE86ED215E!475&amp;amp;ithint=file%2c.pdf&amp;amp;app=WordPdf&amp;amp;authkey=!ABYG6ZzXvRHiw2U"&gt;Enabling Continuous Delivery in Enterprises with Testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/anandbagmar"&gt;Anand Bagmar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=C1C07DFE86ED215E!465&amp;amp;ithint=file%2c.pdf&amp;amp;app=WordPdf&amp;amp;authkey=!AGB6l2FB57h2BYk"&gt;Transforming Software Testing Through Managed Crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mayank-mittal/11/894/a66"&gt;Mayank Mittal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santhosh's talk was refreshingly different. His take on various aspects, including personal relationships, sources of motivation, morality, ways to learn, were unique to him. The candour and humour in his presentation style was impressive. He had everyone laughing through most of his talk. In Q&amp;amp;A, one person asked how this talk was tied to testing. While not explicit, I think most people had gotten the underlying intent: &lt;em&gt;"Set a thief to catch a thief",&lt;/em&gt; ie, to be effective in Security Testing, one needs to learn how to bypass security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anand's talk was a great introduction to some Agile practices that help teams move towards Continuous Delivery. He extrapolated those in an enterprise context, and shared ideas on how to adapt these practices with scale. While most ThoughtWorkers would identify with the concepts already, as these are ingrained in our daily work, the key message of &lt;em&gt;"A Triangle = A Pentagon"&lt;/em&gt; is not something that strikes us naturally, and was definitely novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mayank exposed the audience to a new way of executing testing activity by using &lt;em&gt;crowdsourcing.&lt;/em&gt; He covered the benefits of such an approach and how to go about it. While a simplified breakdown helped us understand the model, during Q&amp;amp;A, Mayank touched upon the hidden complexities as well. This is definitely something to keep an eye on, and perhaps leverage under appropriate circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Aman King at Next Gen Testing 2014" src="http://www.amanking.com/assets/media/images/talks/NextGenTesting2014.JPG" style="float:left; margin: 10px 20px 5px 0px; width: auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made many new connections in the conference. The talk I delivered helped the audience relate with a number of Agile Testing Dilemmas that Vatsala and I incorporated into the presentation. People approached me after the talk, and we engaged in interesting conversations related to their current situations. I felt there were many who had embarked on an Agile journey in their organizations but could use further guidance. There are also misinterpretations and misimplementations to be wary of. They could benefit from some sort of &lt;a href="http://www.amanking.com/agile-coaching-engagements"&gt;Agile Coaching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have loved to attend Day 2 but had to attend the &lt;a href="http://www.amanking.com/jschannel-javascript-conference-2014"&gt;JSChannel JavaScript conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the slides that Vatsala and I had prepared for the conference:&lt;/p&gt;
