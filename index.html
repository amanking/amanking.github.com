<p>Facilitation is a very useful skill to have. It helps not only in <a href="/coaching-basics">coaching</a> but in many day-to-day activities. Whether a team discussion or a team activity, a good facilitator can make all the difference.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Retrospective</h2>

<p>A common facilitation technique is a <em>Retrospective</em>. It has a clear objective of looking back, as a group, at a recent time period or a particular incident, collect thoughts around different aspects, and then brainstorm on action items related to the topic. Agile teams use this technique for continuous improvement. I like relating it to <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">the 12th Agile Principle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While there are some well-known Retrospective formats, I try to customize the experience based on context. This could be how the recent iteration went, the motivation levels of the team, concepts that the team can relate to, or sometimes just something random that could be fun!</p>

<p>During the assessment period of an <a href="/agile-coaching-engagements">Agile coaching engagement</a>, a lot of information is captured around the team's <a href="/process-mapping">current processes and practices</a>. Along with these, gathering quantitative data is also important. These will go into the assessment report at the end, portraying some aspects of current state. Collecting such metrics during assessment is called <em>Metrics Baselining</em>.</p>

<p>Recommendations can be made on the basis of numbers and trends observed, especially using complementary metrics. If the assessment is followed by Agile Adoption, these metrics can be used to indicate progress in chosen areas. From a sustenance point of view, a Before/After comparison around these metrics can determine comfort level and for demonstrating coaching effectiveness.</p>

<p>One may think capturing quantitative data will be simpler than gathering qualitative data. In my experience, the former is trickier and even risky. From a tooling perspective, getting to the numbers might be easy enough. But knowing what numbers actually matter is where the complexity lies. Especially since typically during an assessment, the team and the coach themselves are unaware of exactly where the team's challenges lie, and the assessment is supposed to help discover these. Tracking irrelevant metrics may send a team down a useless path, or worse, a harmful path. Metrics selection should be guided by clear meaningful goals. But when unsure, an Agile Coach may choose to capture whatever can be captured, with a clear disclaimer that it's being done so that the information is available <em>if</em> it becomes useful later. So be sure to archive these metrics somewhere safe.</p>

<p>Some typical metrics captured are as follows.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Productivity</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cycle time</li>
<li>Say/Do ratio</li>
<li>Velocity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc_1">Quality</h3>

<li>Defect count over time</li>

<p>After having collected enough information during the assessment period of an <a href="/agile-coaching-engagements">Agile coaching engagement</a>, especially using <a href="/assessment-interviews">interviews</a>, an Agile Coach should be in a position to draw a <em>Process Map</em> of whatever has been discovered.</p>

<p>You could go use a tool to build a clean and elaborate process map but I recommend starting with stickies. Take a bunch of stickies and write down the important activities that you know different roles get involved in during the start of an iteration, at the end of an iteration, and in-between. Give a short name for the activity and note the name of the role as well. Keep the granularity at medium level, as you don't want too many stickies at once, at least not initially.</p>

<p>Now on a whiteboard, sequence these stickies, one at a time, in the order they are done. Draw connecting lines between the stickies as you proceed. If some activities are repeated, draw loops accordingly. You will now have a visual timeline of an iteration. If you can spot obvious gaps in the timeline, add more stickies for those missing activities along with role participation.</p>

<p>Now you will want to know more about what feeds into an iteration and how, and what goes out of an iteration and how. The former is usually around requirements and defect management. The latter is typically about releases and deployments. In most organizations, customer feedback and customer support connects the end point to the starting point. However, some of this could be just your assumption. It is unlikely you'd have gotten a complete view of the process as some of these aspects are not apparent mid-release nor are all team members aware of them. It is time to get proper validation.</p>

<p>Take a pic of the process map you've come up with, and take it off the board. Keep the stickies handy though. Schedule an hour-long meeting with those roles who'd be aware of these steps at a high level. Typically it is a Project Manager, a Tech Lead, or the Product Owner. Repeat the above process in front of them (using your earlier stickies) but clearly call out every addition you make to the process map. Give them a chance to react at every step, getting either validation or corrections from them. Annotate the flow or the stickies themselves with any details you get. For the gaps or the big picture (before/after iteration), let them call out the activities and the roles involved (you could capture exact names of people as well). Cross-check with what you'd assumed. For those that match, use your stickies. For those that don't, tear off your sticky and create new ones on the fly. In the end, summarize the map on the board to catch any obvious misses.</p>

<p><br><img alt="Process Map" src="/assets/media/images/coaching/process-map.png"><br><small class="muted">Sample process map</small></p>

<p>Keep the map on the board, and show it to team members you had interviewed before. Get their insights about the visual. Mostly it should be a confirmation of the activities depicted. You could also get more details around certain activities. Additionally, you can cross-check different people's viewpoints.</p>

<p>Try to capture this map using a tool or in the simplest case, attach a picture of it on a wiki page that describes the process in words as well.</p>

<p>During the assessment week of an <a href="/agile-coaching-engagements">Agile coaching engagement</a>, the goal is to learn about the current state of the team. Special attention is needed towards capturing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Day-to-day activities of various roles</li>
<li>Additional activities such as on planning day, deployment day, etc</li>
<li>Tools used to support these activities</li>
<li>Processes around these activities</li>
<li>Interaction, collaboration, and dependency on other roles or teams during these activities</li>
<li>Infrastructure environments involved in these activities</li>
<li>Outcome of these activities in an iteration-level view</li>
<li>Challenges faced in performing any of these activities or the role in general</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remain objective while making observations, and to not fall into the temptation of drawing conclusions or making recommendations. The latter is needed but should come towards the end of the assessment when holistic information is available.</p>

<p>One way to get visibility into the above aspects is conducting interviews of team members. We need not talk to everyone but only a representative sample (perhaps 1-2 individuals) from each role. This should be complemented with first-hand observation of how they work. Here is a suggestion of how you could go about this activity.</p>

<p>In Agile consulting, there can be different types of engagements that you get into with your client. One type of engagement may lead to another type. As an Agile Coach, you will find yourself participating across the board. Your focus areas will change based on what the engagement objectives are.</p>

<p>Here are the typical types of engagements I have encountered.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Assessments</h3>

<p>Sometimes a team, a department, or an organization simply is not aware of where they stand with respect to Agile adoption. They need answers to questions like: "Will they benefit from Agile Coaching, or are there too many prerequisites missing? Tentatively for how long will they need coaching before achieving self-sustenance? What areas need the most focus on?" Answering such questions means at least 2-3 days of work, involving interviews, discovery workshops, first-hand observations, metrics collections, etc. This is then followed by summarization and recommendation in the form of an assessment report, which typically contains a proposed coaching plan.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Pilot / Proof of Concept</h3>

<p>Despite Agile initiatives at an organization level, a department could have doubts about whether or not Agile would work for their specific context. In such cases, people agree to a Proof of Concept or Pilot, starting off with Agile Coaching with one selected team for a given duration of time, having a limited set of objectives. If the Pilot goes well, the department may agree to an overall Agile adoption. Coaches involved in a Pilot have to remain very conscious of how their time is spent, what activities they take up, and what focus areas to target, all the while keeping an eye out on measuring and showcasing benefits, even if small. Periodically they will send out progress reports, and finally wrap up the engagement with a summarization that highlights what worked and what did not work, challenges faced, and recommendations to overcome them. It is important to remind clients of what was decidedly out of scope. A Pilot could be anywhere between 2-8 weeks depending on the scope of objectives.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Agile Adoption</h3>

<p>Agile Adoption primarily refers to teams picking up Agile practices and using them for productivity gains and quality improvements. These practices could be process related such as time-boxed iterations, iteration planning, estimation, stand ups, and so on. Or these could be engineering related such as Test-driven Development, Refactoring, Continuous Integration, functional test automation, etc. However, it is established in most circles that Agile is more of a mindset than a set of processes and practices. That said, the latter helps teams try out well-described techniques that may be new to them, and possibly with time and guidance, they are able to see the short-term and long-term benefits behind the practices. Once teams reach this competency level, they are better placed to recognize and embrace the mindset change. This is what the Agile Coach will focus on: helping teams adopt certain practices, and gain higher skill levels in those, while also gradually guiding them towards the reasoning and benefits behind the practices. Tracking the team's progress, checking for any drop in adoption after an initial spike, and continued efforts at sustenance, are also some of the key areas an Agile Coach looks into. Agile Adoption generally takes time, with some factors being team size, project complexity, and attitude and capabilities of team members. An Agile Coach will typically end up coaching multiple teams. Such an engagement can easily range from 2 months to a year.</p>

<p>To me, <a href="/coaching-basics">Coaching</a> is about getting the most out of individuals or teams by raising their awareness levels, about their current environment, about the environment outside theirs, and most important of all, about their own potential. This is done mostly by asking them the right questions, and not by providing them ready-made answers.</p>

<p>My definition of an <em>Agile Coach</em>, on the other hand, is less restrictive. As an Agile Coach, coaching is my primary <em>modus operandi</em>. But there are times when I make recommendations based on my practitioner background. I also complement coaching with aspects of mentoring and training. For example, relating personal experiences and sharing useful resources can increase someone's curiosity and give them a clear direction. Conducting a workshop can help kickstart a group on practices like TDD and Refactoring.</p>

<p>Even within the scope of Agile Coaching, I have been exposed to a variety of roles.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Role-based Practices Coaching</h3>

<p>An Agile Coach helps team members understand their roles in an Agile setting. This involves skills-building. You may join a team as a single cross-skilled coach or as a trio of role-specific coaches: a Tech Coach, a QA Coach, and a BA Coach. With Developers, a coach will pair actively to spread practices like TDD, Refactoring, CI, etc, and will run workshops and brown bag sessions. With Testers, a coach could cover creating test scenarios from acceptance criteria, automated testing, test pyramid, and so on. For Business Analysts or Product Owners, the focus will be on prioritization exercises, negotiation skills, story writing, story slicing, determining NFRs, etc.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Process Coaching</h3>

<p>While focusing on role-specific skills and practices is important, some teams may need help in determining what process works for them, adapting them over time, and so on. This could involve defining how each role contributes to the process, and also in general, how the entire team collaborates and focuses on improvement. Having effective stand ups, planning meetings, demos, and retrospectives fall under this. Other aspects could involve helping the team determine some metrics to observe and improve. Eg: pairing matrix, confidence meter, build failures in a day, velocity, cycle time, etc.</p>

<p>The term <em>Coaching</em> is overloaded.</p>

<p>Comparatively, terms like <em><a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">Refactoring</a></em> and <em><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt">YAGNI</a></em> are recently invented. But despite having had clear definitions to start with, these words still suffer from <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RefactoringMalapropism.html">malapropism</a>.</p>

<p><em>Coaching</em> is a plain English word, around since ages. It is not surprising that its definition in the professional world remains open. This is evident from its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaching">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>That said, there have been attempts to describe coaching better, acknowledging the wide spectrum it could cover, and yet putting some boundaries to it.</p>

<p>My personal view on the term is still evolving despite having played the Agile Coach role. So far I've kept it simple:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coaching is not classroom training; it is interpersonal; it creates awareness in individuals and teams; it is more about asking than telling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have worked on multiple systems written in object-oriented languages. Time and again, I encounter common code smells. What is curious is that these smells are observable not only in legacy<small><sup>[1]</sup></small> systems but also in well-intentioned greenfield<small><sup>[2]</sup></small> projects.</p>

<p>One could ascribe these to the developers not knowing any better, or possibly to a more common reason, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">Technical Debt</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, I have learnt that being conscious of these code smells is important while working with code bases. Simply learning about the code smells is not enough. You need to actively look out for them <em>all the time</em>.</p>

<p>The next step, after identifying the smell, is of course to deal with it. For now, I will only list the code smells. I am planning a separate series of <em>nugget</em> posts to get into more details later. But don't wait for those posts! Read <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">the Refactoring book</a> now for most of the common smells!</p>

<p>For an organization to be successful at Agile transformation, one aspect that needs attention is self-sustenance. Having external coaches is useful as they bring in experience and a third-party perspective. Over time though, it makes sense to groom internal Agile practitioners as Agile champions, who can spread the mindset and practices further.</p>

<p>Transitioning from a practitioner to a coach is non-trivial. The organization should look out for certain characteristics in individuals to identify potential coaches, and follow that up by providing support to prepare them for the role. In a series of articles, we will delve into each of these aspects.</p>

<p>First off, let us establish practitioner-to-coach transition as an effective strategy for Agile transformation.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0"><em>When do we know we are done?</em></h2>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer at the onset of any Agile enablement undertaking. Some answers rely on metrics, measuring how the coached teams have progressed in those. A more subjective answer, but perhaps more relevant, relies on people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are done coaching a team when team members are capable of coaching others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is indicative of the skills, mindset, and experiences picked up by team members. On the ground, not every team member will reach the same level at the same time, and while many may progress as practitioners, they may not make good coaches. Coaching does not come naturally to everyone, not even to long-time practitioners. One needs certain qualities and skills that require further grooming. We will talk about this in more detail later. For now let us assume we can get good coaches out of a coached team.</p>

<p>No, this is not <em>my</em> exit mail. But a post about a reality in any organization: the <strong>exit mail</strong> that appears in our inbox occasionally.</p>

<p>People have their reasons to quit a company. Even a company like <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>. Not always an easy decision. But to each his own. This post is not about the reasons behind the exit mail but about how its readers react.</p>

<p>Thinking about my reactions, I can tie them to the kind of person leaving:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unfamiliar:</strong> With over 2000 ThoughtWorkers, there are bound to be exit mails from people I do not know. I skim through the first paragraph to get a brief background (how long in ThoughtWorks, which location, reason for leaving). If the writing is witty, I might read till the end. Else <em>delete.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respected:</strong> These are the exit mails that make me look twice. I would know the person or know about the person. From working with them, or conversing with them, or reading their forum posts, or simply having heard praises about them from others. These people are opinionated, talented, experienced, and natural leaders in the ways we develop software. These mails get <em>archived.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Team member:</strong> These exit mails always get a <em>reply</em> from me. Having worked with someone, you develop a rapport, some mutual respect, and, on occasion, a camaraderie. How I feel about a team member can vary in degree, and a good measure of that is the effect their exit mail has on me.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Friend:</strong> Such an exit mail <em>hurts.</em> Most times I can anticipate its arrival because the person would keep me informed (it still hurts). Sometimes it can be a shock, if the decision was kept personal for whatever reason. But irrespective, it is a mail I dread. It is hardest to say goodbye to a friend. Each of these mails feels like one lost reason to come to office. But we move on. We have to. And we wish our friends well in their journey ahead.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Exit mails make me think about what we hold dear in this much technical profession of ours. Yes, we appreciate our technology gurus. And we enjoy working with team members towards the common goal of client success. But most of all, we value the friends we make while accomplishing all this. I dedicate this post to such friends of mine.</p>

<p>Amongst software, teams, and individuals, when it comes to exit mail reactions, the priority order is reversed.</p>

<p>I enjoy blogging: writing about my learnings and experiences, and what others may find useful. For many years, I hosted my blog at <a href="http://www.wikyblog.com/AmanKing">WikyBlog</a>.</p>

<p>I blogged regularly during the early parts of my career. After a few years, the posts came in less frequently. This was not accidental. I consciously set off on a personal journey which was more inward-looking.</p>

<p>I now feel the need to blog again. But with a coming-of-age outlook. And a fresh <em>look</em> to go with that.</p>

<p>I am hosting this blog on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, powered by <a href="https://github.com/amanking/ruhoh.rb">my fork</a> of <a href="http://ruhoh.com">ruhoh</a>. It gives me a sense of control as I can create my own theme, and even code my own features.</p>

<p>This blog will capture my thoughts on </p>

<ul>
<li>software, </li>
<li>teams, and </li>
<li>individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these elements are independently worthy of attention. And when these come together, there is great potential to create something worthwhile.</p>

<p>I hope you will find my blog interesting. Keep visiting. I look forward to your thoughts via comments.</p>
